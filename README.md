This is an example of a NodeJS AWS SNS consumer that uses Pact, [PactFlow](https://pactflow.io) and GitHub Actions to ensure that it is compatible with the expectations its consumers have of it.

It is using a public tenant on PactFlow, which you can access [here](https://test.pactflow.io) using the credentials `dXfltyFMgNOFZAxr8io9wJ37iUpY42M`/`O5AIZWxelWbLvqMd8PkAVycBJh2Psyg1`. The latest version of the Example Consumer/Example Provider pact is published [here](https://test.pactflow.io/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider-js-sns/consumer/pactflow-example-consumer-js-sns/latest).

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

* See the canonical consumer example here: https://github.com/pactflow/example-consumer.
* See also the full [PactFlow CI/CD Workshop](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/workshops/ci-cd) for which this can be substituted in as the "consumer".

## Scenario

In the following diagram, we'll be testing the "Consumer", a Lambda function that receives product updates via the `product` SNS topic.

We need to be able to test that we are able to receive (consume) product events from the SNS topic as follows:

![SNS Architecture](docs/js-sns.png "SNS Architecture") 

## Theory

Modern distributed architectures are increasingly integrated in a decoupled, asynchronous fashion. Message queues such as ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, SNS, SQS, Kafka and Kinesis are common, often integrated via small and frequent numbers of microservices (e.g. lambda).

Pact supports these use cases, by abstracting away the _protocol_ and focussing on the messages passing between them.

To reiterate: Pact does not know about the various message queueing technologies - there are simply too many! And more importantly, Pact is really about testing the _messages_ that pass between them, you can still write your standard _functional_ tests using other frameworks designed for such things.

When writing tests, Pact takes the place of the intermediary (MQ/broker etc.) and confirms whether or not the consumer is able to _handle_ a given event, or that the provider will be able to _produce_ the correct message.

### How to write tests?

We recommend that you split the code that is responsible for handling the protocol specific things - in this case the lambda and SNS input - and the piece of code that actually handles the payload.

You're probably familiar with layered architectures such as Ports and Adaptors (also referred to as a Hexagonal architecture). Following a modular architecture will allow you to do this much more easily:

![Code Modularity](docs/ports-and-adapters.png "Code Modularity")

This code base is setup with this modularity in mind:

* [Lambda Handler](src/lambda/product.js)
* [Event Service](src/product/product.service.js)
* Business Logic
    * [Product](./src/product.js)
    * [Repository](./src/product.repository.js)

The target of our [consumer pact test](__tests__/unit/handlers/product.service.pact.test.js) is the [Event Service](src/product/product.service.js), which is responsible for consuming a Product update event, and persisting it to a database (the Repository).

## Pre-requisites

**Software**:

* [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html)
* An AWS account (if you want to actual test and run the lambda function)
*  https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/workshops/ci-cd/set-up-ci/prerequisites/

## Usage

See also the [PactFlow CI/CD Workshop](https://github.com/pactflow/ci-cd-workshop) for more background.

### Testing

* Run the unit tests: `npm t`
* Run a (local) lambda integration test: `npm run test:integration`

### Running

* Deploy the actual app: `./script/deploy.sh` (see below for more background)
* Publish a test event: `npm run publish`
* View the lambda logs: `npm run logs`

Here is some sample output publishing and viewing the logs:
